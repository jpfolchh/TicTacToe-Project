# TicTacToe-Project

## About this Project
This is a simple TicTacToe game

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
1. Add a "Start a New Game" button for when the game ends in a draw:
I will need to create a button that resets the state of the board. Perhaps this can be accomplished by unmounting and then remounting the "Board" component.

2. Color the winning tiles in a new color to show where the player won:
In the "checkFor Winner" function, change the class of the winning tiles to reflect a "winning" color for the squares and the text inside the winning set.
